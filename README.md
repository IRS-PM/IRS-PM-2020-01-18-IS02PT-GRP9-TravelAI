## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Travel is a 2.9 trillion U.S. dollar industry. Aggregator sites scrape the web to present flight deals for a single searched date, and hotel deals for a given date range. Traditional travel agencies offer hassle-free multi-destination travel packages at a premium. However, there is no product that meets the needs of a free and easy, multi-destination traveller who would like to find an itinerary with the lowest overall flight and hotel cost. For this traveller to manually look up all possible combinations of flights and hotels to find the lowest price would be infeasible. An exhaustive search for a trip with n different destinations, and d number of days would amount to (n! × d) searches. 

This project presents a TravelAI, a hassle-free end-to-end solution to this problem. TravelAI is a conversational agent that helps users book travel journeys optimised for their cost and time priorities. It automates the collection of flight and hotel information, solves for the optimal combination that balances cost and time spent at each destination, and books the optimized package with the relevant travel agencies. In addition, it will analyse the user’s profile and destinations and provide a curated list of top places of interest tailored to their interests.
